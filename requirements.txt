1. Customers don’t get replies on time
Salespeople travel a lot. They may be on a site, in a meeting, or on the road.

So many customer emails stay unread.
What happens:
The customer waits
Competitors respond faster
Dealer loses business
 
. Important customer inquiries get lost in the mailbox
Dealers get many emails every day — enquiries, service issues, tender alerts, supplier messages, etc.

Everything is mixed.
What happens:
Some good opportunities are lost
Salesperson forgets to follow up
No proper tracking
 
3. Salespeople don’t have complete customer details
To prepare a quote or order, they need things like:
Customer address
Tax number
Previous machine history
Required machine model
But this info is often missing.
What happens:
They keep asking other teams
Work slows down
Errors happen in the order
 
 
4. Wrong machine details are used in quotes
Machines have many options: bucket size, tires, attachments, warranty, etc.

Salespeople sometimes pick the wrong combination.
What happens:
Customer gets the wrong quote
Rework happens
Delay in closing the deal
 
5. Approvals take too long
To give a discount or confirm stock, salespeople need approval from their manager or accounts team.

These approvals usually happen through email.
What happens:
Manager responds late
Deal gets delayed
Customer becomes frustrated
 
6. Creating purchase orders takes too much time
Before ordering a machine from the manufacturer, dealers must prepare a purchase order (PO).

Salespeople collect details from emails, ERP system, and specifications.
What happens:
Takes 30–90 minutes
Many manual mistakes
Order to the manufacturer gets delayed
 
7. Sales team doesn’t know real-time stock availability
Dealers store machines in different yards or branches.

Salespeople often don’t know what’s in stock right now.
What happens:
They promise machines that are not available
Or they think stock is empty and lose the sale
Confusion everywhere
 
**********8. No clear tracking of ongoing deals
Salespeople track deals using:
WhatsApp
Notes
Excel sheets
Email history
There is no single dashboard.
What happens:
Sales manager has no clear picture
Deals get stuck without anyone noticing
Forecasting becomes difficult
 
9. Salespeople forget to follow up
They get busy and forget to check back with the customer after sending a quote.
What happens:
The customer moves to another dealer
Opportunity is lost
Sales team looks unprofessional
 
10. Tender documents and proposals are slow to prepare
For government or corporate customers, dealers must fill long forms and attach many documents.
What happens:
Takes hours to prepare
They copy from old documents → mistakes happen
Dealer gets rejected for small errors
