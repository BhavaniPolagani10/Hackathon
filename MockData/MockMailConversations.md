**To:** David Brown (Salesperson) <david.brown@heavyequipdealer.com>  
**Date:** November 27, 2025 04:15 PM

David,

Thank you for the quotation on the wheel loader. Unfortunately, your price of $175,000 is significantly higher than other quotes we've received. Unless you can match the $145,000 offer from your competitor, we'll have to pass.

Regards,

Hi Patricia,

I understand price is a key factor. The best I can offer is $168,000 with extended warranty included. This gives you better value in the long run with our comprehensive service package.

Would you like to discuss this further?

We'll need to put this on hold until we can secure alternative funding.

I'm sorry to hear about the financing challenge. We work with several financing partners who may be able to help. Would you like me to connect you with our financing specialist?

Alternatively, we also have a lease-to-own program that might work for your situation.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

**To:** David Brown (Salesperson) <david.brown@heavyequipdealer.com>  
**Date:** December 5, 2025 08:30 AM

---

David,

After reviewing the quote, we realized we actually need a different configuration. We need:
- Larger bucket capacity
- 4WD instead of 2WD
- Enclosed cab with heater

This changes our requirements significantly. We're going to reassess our needs and get back to you.

No problem at all! I'm happy to prepare a new quote once you've finalized your specifications. The upgraded configuration would be approximately $15,000-20,000 more.
